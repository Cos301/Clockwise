Tip: use JENV)\nYou need to create a firebase project (See: https://console.firebase.google.com - You will need to config for your firebase project in the .env files, .firestorerc)\nFirebase CLI (See: https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)\n\nGet Started\n\nFork the repo\n\nGo to: https://github.com/COS-301/miniproject-2023/fork\n\nClone your fork\n\ngit clone git@github.com:/.git \nInstall dependencies\n\ncd path/to/project\nyarn\nAdd Firebase configurations\n\nSee files:\n\n.firebaserc\n.env\n.env.pod\n\nand find and replace \"\"\n\nRun the stack:\n\nRun these commands in separate terminals:\nyarn start:api:dev\nyarn start:emulators\nyarn start:app:dev\nCLI:\n\nIf you want to run the cli for admin, scripts, migrations etc.\nyarn build:cli:prod\nGOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=.keys/ FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:5003 node dist/apps/cli/main.js Emulators:\nOnce the emulators are up, please go to http://localhost:5001 to see the Emulator UI\nNotes!!:\n\nWhen creating your Firebase authentication, hosting, storage, functions. Make sure to use the same location throughout. (MAKE SURE TO SET \"Default GCP resource location\" in Project Settings in Firebase Console. If you do not do this, the app will not work)\nThe app is built to be a PWA. (See: So if you deploy it to prod, you can install the app on iOS by adding to home screen or using Android by installing through Chrome)\n\nGenerating components\nlibraries = shared group of
